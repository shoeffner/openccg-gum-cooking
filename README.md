# OpenCCG GUM cooking

This repository contains the english-cooking grammar for [OpenCCG](https://github.com/OpenCCG/openccg), as well as the related ontologies.
It is based on [GUM 3 space](https://www.ontospace.uni-bremen.de/ontology/gum.html) and the [english-diaspace](http://www.diaspace.uni-bremen.de/cgi-bin/twiki/view/DiaSpace/ReSources.html) grammar, but contains a cooking specific domain and is extended by many rules to parse sentences from the cooking domain.
